 * Description: Finds all biconnected components in an undirected multigraph, and
 *  runs a callback for the edges in each.
 *  In a biconnected component there
 *  are at least two distinct paths between any two nodes. Note that a node can
 *  be in several components. An edge which is not in a component is a bridge,
 *  i.e., not part of any cycle. HOWEVER, note that we are outputting bridges
 *  as BCC's here, because we might be interested in vertex bcc's, not edge
 *  bcc's.
 *
 *  To get the articulation points, look for vertices that are in more than 1 BCC.
 *  To get the bridges, look for biconnected components with one edge
 * Time: O(E + V)
 * Status: tested during MIPT ICPC Workshop 2017
